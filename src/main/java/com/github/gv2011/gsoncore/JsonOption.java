   * <h2>Parser</h2>
   *
   * <p>Configure parser to be liberal in what it accepts. By default,
   * a parser is strict and only accepts JSON as specified by <a
   * href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt">RFC 4627</a>. Setting the
   * parser to lenient causes it to ignore the following syntax errors:</p>
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>Streams that start with the <a href="#nonexecuteprefix">non-execute
   *       prefix</a>, <code>")]}'\n"</code>.
   *   <li>Streams that include multiple top-level values. With strict parsing,
   *       each stream must contain exactly one top-level value.
   *   <li>Top-level values of any type. With strict parsing, the top-level
   *       value must be an object or an array.
   *   <li>Numbers may be {@link Double#isNaN() NaNs} or {@link
   *       Double#isInfinite() infinities}.
   *   <li>End of line comments starting with {@code //} or {@code #} and
   *       ending with a newline character.
   *   <li>C-style comments starting with {@code /*} and ending with
   *       {@code *}{@code /}. Such comments may not be nested.
   *   <li>Names that are unquoted or {@code 'single quoted'}.
   *   <li>Strings that are unquoted or {@code 'single quoted'}.
   *   <li>Array elements separated by {@code ;} instead of {@code ,}.
   *   <li>Unnecessary array separators. These are interpreted as if null
   *       was the omitted value.
   *   <li>Names and values separated by {@code =} or {@code =>} instead of
   *       {@code :}.
   *   <li>Name/value pairs separated by {@code ;} instead of {@code ,}.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <h2>Serializer</h2>
   *
   * <p>Configures a serializer to relax its syntax rules. By default, a serializer
   * only emits well-formed JSON as specified by <a
   * href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7159.txt">RFC 7159</a>. Setting the serializer
   * to lenient permits the following:</p>
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>Top-level values of any type. With strict writing, the top-level
   *       value must be an object or an array.
   *   <li>Numbers may be {@link Double#isNaN() NaNs} or {@link
   *       Double#isInfinite() infinities}.
   * </ul>
